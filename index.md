This project is related to mine because its lighting system is very similar to the intended lighting set up that I will use. This project uses eight WS2812/Neopixel LED light strips that are stacked vertically and programmed to display text, my implementation of this sign will use the microbits 5 high LED resolution and will be about a meter long compared to this project which is about 7 meters long.

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
Art installation that communicates ideas about living with technology.

### Design concept 1 ###
My first idea for an interactive that aligns with the design intent, was inspired by Seiko Mikami's *Desire of Codes* this interactive installation has a range of cameras that follow visitors recording them, this footage is projected onto a screen showing past and present visitors in a cool hexagonal visualization. My idea was to use the microbit to create a smart home device reminiscent of Google home/Alexa, the device would listen to people around it and then play back recording of what people have said around it. The device could even have some visual element to get people talking about it while they're nearby. 

One of the big dampeners on this idea is the limitations of the microbit. Its only a simple device with limited processing power and storage and has pretty limited functionality when it comes to audio. Due to the small storage size the melodies that it can play are short, only a few seconds and as fair as I am concerned there is no way to record sounds.
This combined with the intensive processing that would be required to trim audio clips and play them back puts the microbit in out of its depths.

### Sketch ###

*Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a ** rough sketch ** of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

### Design concept 2 ###


### Final design concept ###
The final design concept is a sculpture that displays text on an LED screen and that text changes as a person approaches and it detected by the sculpture. The LED screen will be the focal point of the sculpture as it will display a range of text strings with different messages; one standard loop and one for when someone is detected to be in front of the sculpture.  The sculpture will be used to provoke interest and attract people to engage in the interaction. 

#### Functionality ####
The technical functionality will vary in complexity the electronic implementation should be quite simple with only a range of LED strips and a sensor to be connected to the micro bit however, the coding side of the project will be quite intensive. 

#### Fabrication ####

#### Aesthetics ####
The aesthetics of Jenny Holzers LEDS have been very inspirational in the conception of the project. With the first conception seeming quite reminiscent of some of her works. 
 ![Image](ledlights.jpg)
 The image above is a sketch of the original conception. The black text is the original imagining of how the project may look. The red text is the revision of the design having a smaller LED screen in the center of the sculpture.  This decision was made to shorten the LED screen after researching the materials to use. It was quickly discovered after a few measurements of a paper prototype that a lot of LEDs will be needed and that it would be quite expensive to have lights running around the whole sculpture. 
It was calculated that the prototype was 336cm long and I intend on using a 5 high LED resolution like the micro bit so this would need 15 meters of LED strips. After looking on the Neopixel website it was found that even buying the cheapest strips (30LEDS/meter) would cost a whole $300+ and this is not feasible, so cutting the LED screen down to 1 meter means this project can be more affordable with almost the same aesthetic effect.

The paper prototype is shown above this was made very simply and was used to estimate the LED cost as well as getting a feel for how the whole thing will look, feel and work.

#### Interaction ####
When considering the interaction I was racking my head to think about how people could engage this the  
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
